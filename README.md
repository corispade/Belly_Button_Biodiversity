# Belly Button Biodiversity Data

# Overview

We have sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. We are creating a dashboard to display our results. Using anonymous participant ID numbers, both research participants and fellow researchers can access the belly button bacteria data collected. 

## Process:
View completed webpage [here](https://corispade.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/)

### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
1. Created arrays to update the bar chart as participant ID is selected
2. Set up the bar chart to display the top 10 bacteria cultures found
3. Created a layout to display the chart with title and axis information
4. Applied the bar chart to the dashboard

### Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
1. Used the above arrays to update the bubble chart as participant ID is selected
2. Set up the bubble chart to display bacteria cultures by sample
3. Created a layout to display the chart with colors, title and axis information
4. Applied the bubble chart to the dashboard 

### Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
1. Created arrays to update the bar chart as the participant ID is selected
2. Set up the gauge chart to display belly button wash frequency per week
3. Created a layout to display the chart with colors and title
4. Appliedc the gauge chart to the dashboard

### Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
1. Added image to jumbotron
2. Formatted text color in jumbtron
3. Formatted text color, font and size in body
4. Added paragrahs to describe chart information
5. Added padding to format page layout
